- [MCP Official Docs](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) — Spec, tutorials, and guides

## Main Assignment

In this session, you will build an MCP server with OAuth authentication — a cat
shop application that exposes tools for browsing products, managing a cart, and
checking out.

The main entry point is:

```text
server.py
```

The server implementation lives in:

```text
app/
```

Available MCP tools:

- `list_products`
- `get_product`
- `add_to_cart`
- `view_cart`
- `remove_from_cart`
- `checkout`

## Setup

From this folder:

```bash
uv sync
```

Copy the example env file and fill in your OpenAI API key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Running the MCP Server

Run the server locally:

```bash
uv run server.py
```

The server starts on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Expose the server with ngrok

In a separate terminal, start an ngrok tunnel:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

Copy the ngrok forwarding URL (e.g. `https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app`) and
restart the server with it:

```bash
ISSUER_URL=https://xxxx-xx-xx-xx-xx.ngrok-free.app uv run server.py
```

> **Note:** The `ISSUER_URL` must match the public URL clients use to reach the
> server, otherwise OAuth authentication will fail.

## Outline

### Breakout Room #1

- Set up the MCP server with OAuth and the product database
- Explore the MCP tools: `list_products`, `get_product`, `add_to_cart`, `view_cart`, `remove_from_cart`, `checkout`

### Breakout Room #2

- Connect an MCP client to the server
- Build an end-to-end interaction flow using the MCP tools

## Ship

The completed MCP server and client integration!

### Deliverables

- A short Loom of either:
  - the MCP server you built and a demo of the client interacting with it; or
  - the notebook you created for the Advanced Build

## Share

Make a social media post about your final application!

### Deliverables

- Make a post on any social media platform about what you built!

## Submitting Your Homework 

Follow these steps to prepare and submit your homework assignment:

1. Review the MCP server code in `server.py` and the `app/` directory
2. Run the MCP server locally using `uv run server.py`
3. Connect to the server using an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop, or a custom client)
4. Test all available tools: browsing products, adding to cart, viewing cart, removing items, and checkout
5. Record a Loom video reviewing what you have learned from this session

## Questions

### Question #1

Why is OAuth important for MCP servers, and what security considerations should you keep in mind when exposing tools to AI clients?

#### Answer

OAuth matters once your server is public. Anyone with the ngrok URL can hit it unless something checks who they are first. I saw this firsthand. Claude Desktop had to sign in before any tool calls worked. Without that, someone could add stuff to a cart or run checkout with zero identity check.
The real issue I hit was the issuer URL. I started the server once pointing at localhost instead of my actual ngrok address. The OAuth endpoint kept saying the issuer was localhost even though Claude was hitting ngrok. Tokens got minted for one address and checked against another, so nothing matched and the connector kept failing.
Main things to watch for: scope tokens narrowly (read vs write), check tokens on every call not just at login, and never let tokens end up in logs or git. Also since free ngrok URLs change every restart, I have to update the issuer and reconnect each time. Easy to forget, and that's a real risk.

### Question #2

What is Streamable HTTP transport in MCP, and why might you expose a server publicly with OAuth instead of using a local stdio connection?

#### Answer

Streamable HTTP is one HTTP endpoint that handles JSON-RPC requests over POST, and can stream back a response when it needs to. It replaced an older setup with two separate endpoints, which made it harder to run behind normal infra like load balancers.
I needed this because stdio only works when client and server are on the same machine, talking through a direct process pipe. My server and Claude Desktop are technically both on my laptop, but the assignment wants it set up like a real remote server, so I ran it through ngrok. Once it's public like that, stdio is off the table. Streamable HTTP is what lets it be reached from anywhere, and OAuth is what stops "reachable from anywhere" from meaning "open to anyone." I confirmed this isn't just theory either, since the connector flat out refused to work until sign-in actually succeeded.

## Activity 1: Extend the MCP Server

Add at least one new tool to the cat shop MCP server (e.g., `search_products`, `update_cart_quantity`, or `get_order_history`). Ensure the new tool integrates properly with the existing database and OAuth authentication. Demo the new tool through an MCP client and include it in your Loom video.

## Advanced Activity: Build a Custom MCP Client

Build a custom MCP client that connects to the cat shop server over Streamable HTTP, authenticates via OAuth, and orchestrates a multi-step shopping flow (browse → add to cart → checkout). Compare the developer experience of MCP-based tool integration vs. traditional REST API calls.

Include your findings and a demo in your Loom video.

### Findings
With MCP, I never had to write a single tool definition by hand. My client called mcp_client.get_tools() and got back all 7 tools, fully described, including the search_products tool I added on the server side last week. I didn't touch the client code to make that new tool available. The agent just had it.
With REST, equivalent functionality means writing one function per endpoint, manually documenting the request shape, the response shape, and the URL pattern for each one. If I want an LLM agent to use this REST API instead of calling it directly in code, I then have to hand-translate every function into a separate tool definition the LLM can understand, describing parameters and return types myself. That's real work, and it's brittle. If the API team renames a field or adds a new endpoint, my hardcoded client breaks silently or stays unaware of the new capability until I update it myself.
